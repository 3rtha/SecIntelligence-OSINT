# SecIntelligence-OSINT
Open-source intelligence is the activity of compiling and evaluating data from publicly accessible sources

Threat intelligence is significant because it gives insight into the tactics, techniques, and frequently used operations by threat actors as well as details on the most recent vulnerabilities and malware, enabling companies to proactively identify and mitigate possible security threats. Organizations can improve their security posture and defend themselves against a variety of cyberthreats, such as advanced persistent attacks, zero-day exploits, and other emerging threats, by utilizing threat intelligence. Among other potential effects, this can aid in preventing data breaches, monetary losses, and reputational harm.
